Project for converting basic HTTP call to WeatherAPI into full micro service

You can build a simple well call using Http methods in java, but that has limited application. In order to expand capabilities and increase
scalability we can incorporate configs, services, models, etc.

This repo is expanding on the http calls used in the WeatherAPI from rapidapi.com. I will be continuing this project but building a data
storage repo, a normalizer, and eventually a front end to represent a full micro service architecture.
